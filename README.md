## User Stories

1.  As a novice user, I want an easy-to-use user interface, so that I don't get frustrated while playing.

    - When a user plays the game, pressing on the grid will highlight it, and tapping on the word will place that word into the grid.

    </p>

    - When a user plays the game, pressing on the grid will highlight it, and then pressing the delete button will remove the word from that grid.

2.  As a novice user, I want hints for words that I don't know, so that I can still progress through the game.

    - When a user gets stuck, tapping on hint button will randomly fill in a grid with the correct answer.

3.  As an expert user, I want an option for harder difficulties, so that I can reinforce my learning.

    - When a user selects to play a random generated game, they will be prompted with three choices of difficulty, easy, medium and hard. Easy will allow the player to know if the word placement was incorrect real-time and more initial given words in the grid. Medium will reduce the initial given words as well as no real-time validation. As for hard, the player will be given a time limit as well, even less initial given words and no real-time validation to challenge the player's true understanding.

4.  As a language learner, I want to progressively learn new word sets, so that I can feel a sense of accomplishment as I learn the language.

    - When a user selects to play the progressive levels gamemode, they will be given levels that they must complete before moving onto the next. Each level will not necessarily get progressively harder, rather each level is a defined category of words the user will be focusing on and to beat the level the user must complete the sudoku within a time limit. Users who try to advance to the next level without completing the previous will be prompted with an error that tells them the level they must complete to unlock this.

5.  As a novice user, I want a help menu, so that I can learn the rules of the game.

    - When a user selects the 'Help' button, a dialog pops up to explain the rules of the game.

6.  As an expert user, I want a leaderboard, so that I can showcase my learning accomplishments.

    - When a user is playing the game, there is a timer to keep track of the time. When the game is completed, the user has the option to enter the score in the leaderboard. The leaderboard is categorized by difficulty, and displays the username and time taken, ranked by time.

7.  As a language learner, I want an option to change to another language, so that there are more varieties of languages to learn.

    - When the user opens the app, they are shown the Home page which includes a dropdown from which the user can select the language they are interested in learning. Once the user clicks on one of the language options, they are able to add word pairs into the Dictionary. Once the desired words they wish to play with are added to the Dictionary, they can select the “Start game” button and a new Sudoku game with those words is created.

8.  As a language teacher, I want to add new words, so that my students can learn specific words and enrich their vocabulary pool.

    - On the home page, there is a button that allows the user to add words to a Dictionary. The user will be able to add word pairings by filling in textboxes and clicking the “Add to Dictionary” button to add the pair of words to the Dictionary. Once at least nine words have been added to the dictionary, users have the ability to select which words they would like to generate a Sudoku board with. Lastly, by clicking on the start game button, a Sudoku board with words from the language the user knows appear on the board while words from the language the user is trying to learn are in the form of buttons.
